<p>I'm a third-year PhD student, developing AI systems that transform complex medical imaging into actionable clinical insights. My research bridges two critical challenges in medical AI: (1) creating interpretable deep learning algorithms for analyzing cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging data, and (2) synthesizing high-fidelity medical imaging data to address data scarcity in rare pathologies. Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from NYU Tandon School of Engineering.</p>

<p>My mission is to democratize access to expert medical diagnosis through robust computational tools that augment physician capabilities. This vision is deeply personal—growing up with physician parents, I witnessed firsthand the challenges of providing quality healthcare in resource-constrained environments. Their dedication inspired my commitment to developing AI systems that can scale medical expertise to underserved populations worldwide.
I approach research with technical versatility, working across the full spectrum of modern AI—from representation learning and transformers to generative models and LLM-based agents—always expanding my skillset to match the complexity of medical challenges.</p>

## Projects

### 1. Unsupervised Representation Learning for Whole‑Heart Fiber Clustering
First-of-its-kind framework that combines self‑supervised embeddings with point‑wise anatomical context (Helical Angle, Transmural Depth) to cluster >400k cardiac fibers.
- **Why it matters:** Enables quantitative studies of myocardial architecture at scale.
- **Status:** Method complete; journal manuscript in preparation (target July 2025).  
- **Preprint:** [[arXiv 2504.01953]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01953)

### 2. Multi‑Mask 3D Generative Framework for Pancreatic Cysts
Conditional GAN architecture with organ & lesion masks to synthesize realistic 3‑D MRI volumes of pancreatic cysts.
- Automated lesion‑mask generation → controllable pathology placement.
- **Open data:** First large‑scale synthetic cyst MRI dataset to be released by July 2025.
- **Code:** coming soon · **Paper:** in prep.
